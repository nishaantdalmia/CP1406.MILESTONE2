                <h2>PRODUCT INFORMATION</h2> <br>
<h4>Do your products contain gluten?</h4><br>
As a general rule, the gluten in our frozen dessert products is present only in added bakery products such as cookies, cake, or brownies. All products that are gluten-free are clearly marked as such on the packaging and the website. <br>
<h4>Do you pasteurize your fruit ingredients ?</h4><br> 
All our fruit is pasteurized using the high-temp/short-time method, which kills all of the bad bacteria. <br>
<h4>Do any of your products contain animal derivatives other than pork in gelatin?</h4><br> 
Eggs and milk are animal-derived, but as two of the eight major allergens, they are always disclosed in the ingredient statement. There may be eggs in some inclusions such as cookie dough, and eggs are sometimes used as a stabilizing ingredient. Aside from the gelatin in the marshmallows and marshmallow variegates, we have no other ingredients that are animal-derived. <br>
<h4>What stabilizers do you use in your products?</h4><br>  
In keeping with our philosophy of using only the purest ingredients, we use only eggs to stabilize Diazepam Café. All our eggs are completely pasteurized. 
<h4>Do your products contain alcohol? ?</h4><br>
Several of our ice cream products contain alcohol. The alcohol is used as an agent to carry flavor in our super-premium ice cream. <br>
<br><h4>Do you make low-fat or non-fat products?</h4><br>
All of the DiazePam Café sorbet products are non-fat, with the exception of chocolate sorbet. DiazePam Café frozen yogurt flavours are low fat. <br>



<h2>PRODUCT STORAGE AND SERVING</h2><br>
<h4> What’s the best temperature for product storage?</h4> <br>
DiazePam Café products are best stored at home, unopened, at 0 degrees F (-18 degrees C). For extended storage up to the "best before" date, we recommend -10 degrees F (-23.3 degrees C) or colder, when possible. <br>
<h4>How do I know if my DiazePam Café product is at its best quality? </h4><br>
When kept at the recommended storage temperature, DiazePam Café products are excellent through the "best before" date found on the package. A "best before" date is found on the bottom of each carton and end flap of the bar packaging. <br>
<h4>How should I serve my DiazePam Café products? </h4><br>
To deliver the best flavor and texture, allow your DiazePam Café products to soften at room temperature for approximately 10 minutes, depending on the actual room temperature and the temperature of your freezer. <br>
<h4>Can DiazePam Café products be refrozen after they've thawed? </h4><br>
No. because we make DiazePam Café products in the most natural way possible, DiazePam Café products should not be refrozen if thawed. Thawing and refreezing can create large ice crystals and cause undesirable grainy/gritty textures or diminished quality. <br>
